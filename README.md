Story Builder is an app for children who are just learning to read to support their engagement with words. This application is built in Unity using RTVoice for enabling Text-To-Speech and featuring a robust drag and drop system.

To open the project in a Windows environment, begin by cloning this repository on your local machine. Once cloned, the file MultiPlatformStoryBuilder/Assets/StoryBuilder.unity scene file may be double-clicked to open with your installed distribution of Unity. Once opened, modify the build settings for Android and click the Play button triangle at the top of the screen. To change your build settings, follow the below tutorial for building to Android devices. If you experience trouble with the scene opening you may wish to try the same version of Unity (Unity 5.5.0 https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) that the project was built on.
